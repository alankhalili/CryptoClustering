# Crypto Clustering Project

## Overview
This project aims to perform clustering on cryptocurrencies to identify patterns and similarities based on their market data. This approach uses principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction followed by K-means clustering to group similar cryptocurrencies.

## Files
- `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all the analyses.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Ensure that Python and all required packages are installed.
2. Open the `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb` notebook.
3. Execute the cells sequentially to see the analysis and the clustering results.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following cryptocurrency market metrics:
- `price_change_percentage_24h`
- `price_change_percentage_7d`
- `price_change_percentage_14d`
- `price_change_percentage_30d`
- `price_change_percentage_60d`
- `price_change_percentage_200d`
- `price_change_percentage_1y`

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and preprocessing steps to prepare data for analysis.
2. **PCA for Dimensionality Reduction**: Implementation of PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining the essential characteristics.
3. **Clustering with K-means**: Application of K-means clustering to group the cryptocurrencies into clusters based on the reduced features from PCA.

## Results
- Visualization of PCA results and interpretation of principal components.
- Analysis of clustering results, including the characteristics of each cluster and visualizations using pair plots and scatter plots.

## Conclusions
The notebook concludes with insights derived from the clusters and how these clusters relate to the overall market behavior of cryptocurrencies.
